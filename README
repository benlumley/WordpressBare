= Base Wordpress Install =

This is a plain vanilla wordpress install with a few things I like on every project pre-done.

 - Wordpress itself is a submodule under /wordpress. This makes gitting, sorting out wordpress upgrades, etc much easier.
 - wp-content is not within WordPress, it's been moved to wordpressâ€“content, which makes it possible to keep WordPress itself out of version control but still version control themes/plugins
