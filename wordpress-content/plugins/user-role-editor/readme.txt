== Changelog ==
= 3.8 =
* 01.09.2012
* Bug fix: Some times URE didn't show real changes it made to the database. The reason was that direct update of database did not invalidate data stored at WordPress cache. Special thanks to [Knut Sparhell](http://sparhell.no/knut/) for the help to detect this critical issue.
* WordPress core capabilities are shown separately from capabilities added by plugins and manually.
* If you configured URE to show you 'Administrator' role, you will see its capabilities, but you can not exclude any capability from it. I may just add capabilities to the Administrator role now. The reason - Administrator role should have all existing capabilities included.
* Brasilian Portuguese translation is updated. Thanks to [Onbiz](http://www.onbiz.com.br/).

= 3.7.5 =

* Old versions used 'edit_users' capability to check if show/hide 'User Role Editor' menu item under 'Users' menu. Starting from version 3.7 'administrator' role is checked. Existed inconsistency, when non-admin user with 'edit_users' capability saws 'User Role Editor' menu, but got 'Only Administrator is allowed to use User Role Editor' error message, was removed.
* Bug fix: if you work with WordPress admin via https, URE will use https instead of http, as it made in older versions.
